COMP 20 Main Directory

Purpose:
------
This git repository is used for version control of various labs and assignments in COMP 20 (Web Programming) at Tufts University. All work was provided by Adam Plumer, with references to other contributors cited in each directory's respective README file. All previous changes and progress may be tracked for any individual body of work from this webpage.

Favorite Lab Assignment:
------
My favorite lab was on client-side persistance and using HTML5's LocalStorage feature. It was a part of web programming and design that I had always been interested in, but had never pursued. In this case, we used it for the Captain's Log lab (Lab 7). Learning about client-side persistance is very important for non-sensitive information, ridding the need for server-side persistance for every piece of data.

Personal Growth:
------
Over the course of the semester, I have learned a lot more about jQuery, node.js, and Mongo than I had otherwise. At the beginning of the course, I had some previous experience in HTML, CSS, and rudimentary Javascript, although I learned more about each as well. In particular, I learned about finding the size of a particular window and resizing the elements in response to that. I also learned about how to increase modularity and abstraction by using css files for all styling, instead of using HTML5's style attributes.

Most Important Part:
------
The most important thing I learned in this course was how to set up a web server using node.js. Previous to this course, I had no server-side experience at all, except for simple PHP scripts that called a MySQL database. However, setting up a server and defining how it serves different paths is incredibly useful. For instance, instead of simply having all files available in a certain directory, serving them as needed, the content can be served dynamically, or data can be transmitted without styling. Although PHP can handle a lot of this, I've found node to be more robust, especially now that I've had some formal training in it.

Future Learning:
------
In future studies, I'd like to delve deeper into server-side web setup and maitenance on a variety of server platforms. I'd also like to do more mobile web programming and app integration.
