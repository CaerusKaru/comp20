1. All elements have been correctly implemented. The JSON is parsed, and outputted using the stylesheet in the correct div on the webpage

2. I have not collaborated with anyone, but I did use the posted resources on the lab assignment page. I also used some of my previous work on assignment two to help finish the lab

3. It took approximately twenty minutes to complete this lab

4. The answer to the questions for Parts 2 and 3 are no, neither method works. As the Google Chrome debugging console states, 'No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access.' for part 3, and 'Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, chrome, chrome-extension, https, chrome-extension-resource.' for part 2.
