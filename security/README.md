1. All elements have been correctly implemented. The security report has been completely written, with all sections completed to the published requirements

2. I have collaborated with Liam Brady (the source of the security report) to get source code and access to the servers in question. I have also used Garbiel Brody's security report as a template for how to frame my own report. Finally, I used the resources available in the course to look for vulnerabilities

3. It took approximately two hours to complete this assignment
