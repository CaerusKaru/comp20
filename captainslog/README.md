1. All elements have been correctly implemented. Lyrics display properly and for the correct amount of time, and the images appear and disappear correctly

2. I have not collaborated with anyone, but I did use the posted resources on the lab assignment page. The two images were also taken from google searches for "corn-tops" and "sun shines"

3. It took approximately two hours to complete this lab
